# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_JNI_INCLUDE_DIR
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   AX_JNI_INCLUDE_DIR finds include directories needed for compiling
#   programs using the JNI interface.
#
#   JNI include directories are usually in the Java distribution. This is
#   deduced from the value of $JAVA_HOME, $JAVAC, or the path to "javac", in
#   that order. When this macro completes, a list of directories is left in
#   the variable JNI_INCLUDE_DIRS.
#
#   Example usage follows:
#
#     AX_JNI_INCLUDE_DIR
#
#     for JNI_INCLUDE_DIR in $JNI_INCLUDE_DIRS
#     do
#             CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -I$JNI_INCLUDE_DIR"
#     done
#
#   If you want to force a specific compiler:
#
#   - at the configure.in level, set JAVAC=yourcompiler before calling
#   AX_JNI_INCLUDE_DIR
#
#   - at the configure level, setenv JAVAC
#
#   Note: This macro can work with the autoconf M4 macros for Java programs.
#   This particular macro is not part of the original set of macros.

# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_PROG_JAR
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   AX_PROG_JAR tests for an existing jar program. It uses the environment
#   variable JAR then tests in sequence various common jar programs.
#
#   If you want to force a specific compiler:
#
#   - at the configure.in level, set JAR=yourcompiler before calling
#   AX_PROG_JAR
#
#   - at the configure level, setenv JAR
#
#   You can use the JAR variable in your Makefile.in, with @JAR@.
#
#   Note: This macro depends on the autoconf M4 macros for Java programs. It
#   is VERY IMPORTANT that you download that whole set, some macros depend
#   on other. Unfortunately, the autoconf archive does not support the
#   concept of set of macros, so I had to break it for submission.
#
#   The general documentation of those macros, as well as the sample
#   configure.in, is included in the AX_PROG_JAVA macro.

# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_PROG_JAVA
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Here is a summary of the main macros:
#
#   AX_PROG_JAVAC: finds a Java compiler.
#
#   AX_PROG_JAVA: finds a Java virtual machine.
#
#   AX_CHECK_CLASS: finds if we have the given class (beware of CLASSPATH!).
#
#   AX_CHECK_RQRD_CLASS: finds if we have the given class and stops
#   otherwise.
#
#   AX_TRY_COMPILE_JAVA: attempt to compile user given source.
#
#   AX_TRY_RUN_JAVA: attempt to compile and run user given source.
#
#   AX_JAVA_OPTIONS: adds Java configure options.
#
#   AX_PROG_JAVA tests an existing Java virtual machine. It uses the
#   environment variable JAVA then tests in sequence various common Java
#   virtual machines. For political reasons, it starts with the free ones.
#   You *must* call [AX_PROG_JAVAC] before.
#
#   If you want to force a specific VM:
#
#   - at the configure.in level, set JAVA=yourvm before calling AX_PROG_JAVA
#
#     (but after AC_INIT)
#
#   - at the configure level, setenv JAVA
#
#   You can use the JAVA variable in your Makefile.in, with @JAVA@.
#
#   *Warning*: its success or failure can depend on a proper setting of the
#   CLASSPATH env. variable.
#
#   TODO: allow to exclude virtual machines (rationale: most Java programs
#   cannot run with some VM like kaffe).
#
#   Note: This is part of the set of autoconf M4 macros for Java programs.
#   It is VERY IMPORTANT that you download the whole set, some macros depend
#   on other. Unfortunately, the autoconf archive does not support the
#   concept of set of macros, so I had to break it for submission.
#
#   A Web page, with a link to the latest CVS snapshot is at
#   <http://www.internatif.org/bortzmeyer/autoconf-Java/>.
#
#   This is a sample configure.in Process this file with autoconf to produce
#   a configure script.
#
#     AC_INIT(UnTag.java)

#     dnl Checks for programs.
#     AC_CHECK_CLASSPATH
#     AX_PROG_JAVAC
#     AX_PROG_JAVA

#     AX_CHECK_RQRD_CLASS(org.xml.sax.Parser)
