1. Introduction
***************

Contents of this directory will help you to :

- Create databases used by ze-filter to do bayesian filtering
  (learning)

- Checking messages by hand

The contents of this directory will be installed as 
    /var/ze-filter/bayes-toolbox


2. Requirements
***************

To use this tools, you need to compile and install ze-filter. Mainly,
you'll need two programs from ze-filter distribution : ze-makemap (to
handle BerkeleyDB databases) and ze-bayes-tbx (to extract tokens from
messages and check messages).


3. Basic Learning
*****************

Learning means create databases used by the filter to evaluate the
score to be assigned to a message or a set of messages.

You need some mailboxes, both hams and spams. Spams and Hams shall be
in different files. So, this is some work to be done by hand by a
human being.

Spams and Hams files are identified by their extensions :

	hbox    -> HAM
	sbox	-> SPAM

Put the mailboxes to be learned inside "bayes/learn" directory, and
simply type :

	cd learn
	make

This will create everything. The filter will look for a database in the
BerkeleyDB format inside  /var/ze-filter/cdb directory.

For your convenience, you can launch :

	make install

This will both copy the required database into work directory, but also
tell the daemon to use the new database.

4. Updating learning database
*****************************

The learn.sh script allows you to manage the learning process. This means,
if you have some way to collect message samples and want to use them to
update the training database. It's just enough to put them inside some
directory and periodically launch this script to feed them into ze-filter
learning chain. learn.sh will do the rest for you.

You'll eventually need to take a look into learn.sh (the documentation is
integrated in it) and eventually modify some path values in order to adapt
it to your installation.

learn.sh is a contribution from Thomas Spahni.


5. Checking filter efficiency
*****************************

Use the ze-bayes-tbx executable :

	ze-bayes-tbx -c [ -p -x -v ] mailbox

REM : play with p, x and v options to see what they do

	-v   : verbose - this will show the real score of
         checked message
        -x   : when checking an entire mailbox, this will
         present the histogram of scores
	-b   : use this option to specify a different path
         to the bag of words database
