How to use this stuff.

This stuff allows using URL blacklists with ze-filter.

The following files are important to you :

j-urlbl.txt
  This file is a startup database. 
  It contains spammers URLs from two sources :
  - URLs from surlbl.org ( check their site )
  - URLs from SPAMs sent or given to ze-filter author.

etc directory - Two scripts are installed at /etc/ze-filter
  directory :

  - get-urlbl - this script shall be called a number of
    times a day (say each 6 or 12 hours) to update database. 
    It connects to ze-filter rsync server, gets a new text 
    version of the database and create the corresponding 
    BerkeleyDB databases used by ze-filter.

  - Makefile.db - this makefile is used by the above script
    and defines how text database is converted to BerkeleyDB
    database

  So, you shall add something at your crontab :

  10 9,21 * * * cd /etc/ze-filter; ./get-urlbl

src directory - this is a working directory, not necessary
  for the moment, and will be used someday, if you want to
  convert text databases (one URL per line) into the text 
  database format used by ze-filter. Other usage of the
  contents of this directory is to get and converts URLs
  database from surbl.org. surbl.org databases are in the
  format of rbldnsd server.
