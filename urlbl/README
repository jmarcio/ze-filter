How to use this stuff.

This stuff allows using URL blacklists with j-chkmail.

The following files are important to you :

j-urlbl.txt
  This file is a startup database. 
  It contains spammers URLs from two sources :
  - URLs from surlbl.org ( check their site )
  - URLs from SPAMs sent or given to j-chkmail author.

etc directory - Two scripts are installed at /etc/mail/jchkmail
  directory :

  - get-urlbl - this script shall be called a number of
    times a day (say each 6 or 12 hours) to update database. 
    It connects to j-chkmail rsync server, gets a new text 
    version of the database and create the corresponding 
    BerkeleyDB databases used by j-chkmail.

  - Makefile.db - this makefile is used by the above script
    and defines how text database is converted to BerkeleyDB
    database

  So, you shall add something at your crontab :

  10 9,21 * * * cd /etc/mail/jchkmail; ./get-urlbl

src directory - this is a working directory, not necessary
  for the moment, and will be used someday, if you want to
  convert text databases (one URL per line) into the text 
  database format used by j-chkmail. Other usage of the
  contents of this directory is to get and converts URLs
  database from surbl.org. surbl.org databases are in the
  format of rbldnsd server.
