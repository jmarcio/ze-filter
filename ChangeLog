ze-filter Change Log

Version 0.2.0
*************

First release of this filter after fork of j-chkmail

* many parts of the filter were rewritten. First of all because
  of the fork and also to clean-up some code which may be 
  improved.
  This is a work in progress.

* Everything was renamed to replace every mention to j-chkmail to
  ze-filter : configuration files, directories, ...

* Embedded Berkeley DB and PCRE library were upgraded.

* A first version of filter-tools (or ze-tools) were included in the
  contrib directory. These tools are intended to help people manage
  quarantine and ze-filter monitoring.

* A script :
    migrate-j-chkmail-2-ze-filter
  can help people to migrate from j-chkmail to ze-filter

More info soon at the wiki.
