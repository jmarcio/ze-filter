==== Version 0.5.0 - 11-Feb-2018 ====



  * ze-filter runs now as user:group ze-filter:ze-filter. This user:group shall exists before installation of the filter. Maybe : ''useradd -d /var/ze-filter -s /bin/bash -m -u 900 ze-filter''
  * Some references to /usr/bin/... at some commands inside config/startup/Makefile and startup files. Noticed by Guy Carre
  * Some small bugs in ''systemd'' startup files - noticed by Dudi Goldenberg.
  * A script update-db.sh replacing both /var/ze-filter/cdb/get-urlbl and /var/ze-filter/cdb/get-bayes : simpler and more reliable.
  * ''**contrib/filter-tools**'' was more extensively tested and documented.
  * ''**contrib/rrd-ze-filter**'' was more extensively tested, simplified and documented.
  * ''**contrib/munin/ze-filter-counters_**'' munin-monitoring plugin added and documented.



==== Version 0.4.0 - 04-Feb-2018 ====



  * removal of some buglets regarding the name change.
  * systemd scripts. Old SysV "init.d" are considered deprecated and aren't installed anymore by default. \\ Well, this may seems confusing but ''systemd'' is now the recommended way to start daemons and are available at recent releases of ''Debian'', ''RedHat'', ''CentOS'', ''Ubuntu'', ''Fedora'', ...\\ It's a simpler, uniform and more reliable way to manage daemons. \\ Old init.d scripts are still there but if you really need them, you can just copy them, by hand, to /etc/init.d directories. 
  * Moving/renaming/reorganizing some directories and files - transparent to final users. //Work in progress//.


==== Version 0.2.0 - 02-Feb-2018 ====




First release of this filter after fork of j-chkmail



  * many parts of the filter were rewritten. First of all because of the fork and also to clean-up some code which may be improved. This is a work in progress.
  * Everything was renamed to replace every mention to ''j-chkmail'' to ''ze-filter'' : configuration files, directories, ...
  * Embedded Berkeley DB and PCRE library were upgraded to 6.2.32 and 3.41, respectively.
  * A first version of filter-tools (or ze-tools) were included in the contrib directory. These tools are intended to help people manage quarantine and ze-filter monitoring.
  * A script : ''**migrate-j-chkmail-2-ze-filter**'' can help people to migrate from j-chkmail to ze-filter
  * More info soon at the wiki. ''**ze-filter**'' source tarball is available at : [[http://foss.jose-marcio.org/download]] or at [[http://github.com/jmarcio/ze-filter]]
