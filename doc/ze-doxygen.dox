/**
 * @mainpage ze-filter : source code documentation
 *
 * This documentation is just a help for the filter programmer. 
 * Maybe I should say : more than just a help...
 *
 * A little bit of history : this filter beginning was around at the end of 
 * year 2001. Most of its development happened during years 2001-2010. So,
 * most of its code were built upon its base, trying to remain coherent.
 *
 * The first feature of the filter was filtering based on the file extension 
 * of attached files (.exe, .com, ...). This was immediately followed by 
 * evaluating connection rate of SMTP clients, after a DoS attack against 
 * our mail servers. Other filtering ideas were tested and implemented during 
 * these 10 years.
 *
 * So, I can't talk "bottom-up" programming but "incremental" programming. 
 * This isn't always a good programming practice, but it's what should be done 
 * because, at the beginning, there were no system specifications and I didn't 
 * knew what this filter could be.
 *
 * At the same time, mail filtering is a moving domain, new spam and malware 
 * tricks appears all the time.
 *
 * Within this context, it's not unusual that some incoherence appear in the 
 * source code : variable names, code redundancy, ...
 *
 * Other than the usual goal of documenting this code, this tool is intended 
 * to help a task of code revision. And Doxygen is a great tool to do this.
