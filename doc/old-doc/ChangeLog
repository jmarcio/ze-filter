	headers.

  [FEATURE] Some configuration data files are available for download
	at http://foss.jose-marcio.org/data/conf-data

  [FEATURE] FROM_PASS_TOKEN and TO_PASS_TOKEN configuration options added
	allowing to generate handling exceptions. Ex: if you run a good

        and at j-policy database you declare :
	   GreyCheckTo:-owner@lists.domain.com	NO
        and bounce addresses of your list are of the form 
	    listname-owner@list.domain.com
	Bounces won't be greylisted. This is a good idea. Asked by
	Serge Aumont.
	You can also use this to let some messages with executable
	files pass through the filter. In this case, you define :
	   TO_PASS_TOKEN       +somerandomtoken@domain.com
	and add to your j-policy database :
	   XFilesCheck:+somerandomtoken@domain.com     NO.

   [CHANGE] Quarantined messages containing XFILES have now the
      suffix ".xfile" appended. This allows to identify files
      on the quarantine directory when they are there as they
      have an XFILE attached or if the filter was killed without
      closing open connections.
   [FEATURE] Quarantine management script included on the distribution
      Contribution from Christian Pelissier.
   [BUG] Address extraction on SPAMTRAPs problem. Corrected.
   [CHANGE] j-urlbl database is now distributed on compressed format.

Oct 14 - 1.7 RC3
   [BUG] j-chkmail doesn't compile if target machine doesn't have
      auto(conf|make) tools installed

Sep 30 - 1.7 RC2
   [CONFIG] get-urlbl and Makefile.db scripts needed to create
     URL blacklist are installed at /etc/mail/jchkmail directory.

Sep 14 2004 
  j-chkmail 1.7 RC1
  [FEATURE] Environnement variables. Some variables were defined :
    These variables are to be set usually at default configuration
    scripts : /etc/default/j-chkmail or /etc/sysconfig/j-chkmail
    - XFILEs extensions         FILE_EXT
    - libmilter debug level     MILTER_DEBUG_LEVEL
    - filter log level          JCHKMAIL_LOG_LEVEL
    - database cache size       DB_CACHE_SIZE
  [FEATURE] Some scripts created at bin directory. Not installed
        by default
        - get-urlbl - update URL database. To be launched by cron
        - j-ndc - script to connect to control channel and control
          and query the filter
  [BUG] Some MIME Content-Disposition/Content-Type could be bad
        interpreted when some virus add spaces around "=" sign.
  [CONFIG] Some configuration options added.
        - timeout waiting for external scanner
        - max message size to pass to external scanner
        - Internal options for sophos scanner
  [FEATURE] get-urlbl script to rsync and install urlbl.
  [FEATURE] Support for Sophos SAVI - integrate sophos libraries
        into j-chkmail filter, and a scanner daemon.
  [FEATURE] sophosd - a daemon doing virus scan and using Sophos
        savi library.
  [FEATURE] Block messages coming from NULL SENDER, when the
        number of recipients is greater than one and the connection
        comes from an unknown network.
  [FEATURE] Detect messages which body is empty or near empty.
  [FEATURE] Check enveloppe addresses syntax
  [CHANGE] Internal protocol between j-chkmail and the external
        scanner changed to put allways a return code on each line.
  [FEATURE] XFILES 
        * Possibility of add TNEF and CLSID files to XFILES 
          class. Validation is done at j-xfiles configuration file.
        * Detection of message/partial and message/external
          MIME content type is integrated into j-chkmail code (no
          more as FFR). Validation of this as a XFILE is done
          at j-xfiles configuration file.
        * It's now possible to completely define what XFILES are
          at j-xfiles configuration file. Nowadays j-chkmail.cf
          FILE_EXT et FILE_REGEX will be obsoleted sometime 
          in the future.
  [FEATURE] Policy database... Under construction...
  [CHANGE] Message content is now checked before calling external
        virus scanner (the order was inversed)
  [CHANGE] Integer configuration values of j-chkmail.cf file can be
        now expressed with units :
	   Time   :  s,m,h,d default = s
	   Units  :  (K,M,G) -> (1024, 1024**2, 1024**3)
  [FEATURE] Adding option to setup BerkeleyDB cache size (configuration
        file and environnement variable)
  [UPDATE] Bundled PCRE updated from 4.4 to 4.5

Jun 11 2004
  j-chkmail 1.7 Alpha-7
  [FEATURE] HELO/EHLO parameter check : numeric vs value
  [FEATURE] URL Blacklist - database and/or DNS based.
  [FEATURE] j-makemap tool to create database (j-chkmail equivalent of
       sendmail makemap). Needed to create URLBL database.
  [CHANGE] /var/jchkmail/j-regex format changed to include both pattern 
       matching and URL blacklist logging.
  [CHANGE] j-regex-stat.pl modified to correctly handle new j-regex
       file format.
  [FEATURE] - j-dburlbl-stat.pl script added to generate statistics
       about URL blacklist detection. Changed to j-urlbl-stat with
       three possible parameters
           j-urlbl-stat -t DBURLBL
           j-urlbl-stat -t URLBLSTR
           j-urlbl-stat -t URLBLEXPR	
  [FEATURE] CPU load measure under FreeBSD
  [CHANGE] IP address information added to /var/jchkmail/j-files.
       j-xstat.pl contrib/script modified accordingly.
  [BUG] Error decoding filename with spaces in a uuencoded
       attachment
  [OPTION] "z" command line option. This option makes the daemon set
       work directory to "/tmp" instead of "/"., in order to allow core 
       dump when debug is needed.
       Check documentation for details.
  [FEATURE] New command defined for the control channel 
       which prints the histogram of message scores (# of Xs).
		STATS SCORES
		STATS ORASCORE
		STATS REGSCORE
  [BUG] Quoted Printable decoder - some tricky qp coded messages could
       generate an error.
  [OPTION] Compile time option _FFR_REGEX_ACCESS added to select if
       j-access address matching is regular expression based. To
       activate this, j-chkmail shall be configured with :
          ./configure ...OPTIONS...  CFLAGS="-D_FFR_REGEX_ACCESS=1"
  [OPTION] CLUSTER option added to j-chkmail.cf configuration file. Setting
       this option to yes will allow using j-chkmail in a cluster sharing
       resources. This option changes two things :
       - "Connect from" log line will show the hostname of the mailserver,
         as defined by the Macro $j. This is necessary when the filter
         is shared between multiple mail servers
       - j-chkmail spool filename will created with the mailserver hostname
         prepended to the connection ID. This is neccessary when the
         spool is shared by multiple filters.
  [CHANGE] - Connection rate control and Open connections control are now
       alse checked at connection time (instead of only at helo callback),
       to prevent from gateways abusing the delay between CONNECT and
       EHLO.
  [CHANGE] AVL binary tree management module was completely rewritten and
       recursion removed to solve some segmentation fault issues under FreeBSD.
  [FEATURE] Two new kind of lines created at j-regex configuration file
       for faster URL pattern matching : URLEXPR and URLSTR.
  [CHANGE] Under FreeBSD, start-up script was renamed from jchkmail.sh to
       jchkmail, to best conform with FreeBSD rules.
  [FEATURE] New configuration option SCORE_ON_SUBJECT. If set, the spam score
       will be also represented on the Subject Header as a number of Xs in a
       tag of the kind [J-XXX]
  [CHANGE] Under sendmail 8.13.0, j-chkmail will close SMTP connection 
       instead of simply sending an error DSN, in certain cases : 
         - too much open connections
         - connection rate exceeded
         - global number of file descriptors too high
         - too much bad recipient errors
  [CHANGE] Rejecting intranet users from external messages no more
        checks host address part against class W. You shall define
        intranet users in one of these three ways :
        -  user@host,  user or @host
  [CHANGE] Results of control channel commands 
             STATS ( SCORES | ORASCORE | REGSCORE )
           is now presented in cumulative mode

	
Apr 09 2004
  j-chkmail 1.6 RC3
  [CHANGE] __TO__ variable defined at j-error-msg configuration file
       and set to use "To" header.
  [UPDATE] j-printstats reports also number of virus detected when
       launched with options "-q -m x".
  [UPDATE] All references to j-host-access were finally removed.
  [UPDATE] USE_TCPWRAPPER configuration option removed as TCP Wrapper
       is no longer needed to control access to control channel
  [BUG] j-printstats -q doesn't print individual individual connection
       rate for smtp clients when connection rate control isn't enabled.
  [BUG] NO_RESOLVE_CHECK wasn't handled correctly.
  [DOC] Some more doc...

Mar 30 2004
  j-chkmail 1.6 RC2
  [UPDATE] j-xstat.pl script (contrib/scripts) was updated to handle
       j-files and checking quarantine directory contents using or
       ClamAV clamdscan, McAfee uvscan or Sophos sweep, to identify
       blocked virus.
  [BUG] Imcomplete code at load measure functions, under FreeBSD and
       TRU64. Code fully implemented only on Solaris and Linux platforms.
  [DOC] Some more lines inserted at FAQ.

Mar 22 2004
  j-chkmail 1.6 RC1
  [FEATURE] PCRE was integrated to the package - no more need to 
       install PCRE as an external package and configure it.
  [BUG] Some installation issues regarding rpm packaging and configuration
       files not being installed at default places. Thanks to Robert Schmitt.
  [TEST] Using NO_RESOLVE_CHECK was validated - no more need to use the
       j-host-access configuration file. Entries at this file shall be
       replaced by entries of the following kind at j-access configuration
       file :
             Connect:IP_ADDRESS      NO_RESOLVE_CHECK
  [TEST] Validation of saving quarantined messages at UNIX text format
       instead of SMTP text format.

	could generate bad interpretation of normal files.

Mar 04 2004
  j-chkmail 1.5-Alpha-3
  [FEATURE] Added file /var/jchkmail/j-virus, which is the equivalent of
       j-files, and allows to get stats from virus. Each virus is logged

  [BUG] Found a bug (possibility of buffer overflow) on the statistical 
       evaluation of message word length (oracle).
  [CHECKING] External virus scanner tested with Trendmicro. Thanks to
       Cove Schneider, who adapted the perl script and did the tests.
  [DOC] Added some installation doc to the rrdtool-jchkmail directory.
  [CHANGE] Add checking to existence of initialisation scripts at
       /etc/sysconfig/jchkmail and /etc/default/jchkmail. As startup script
       is overwritten after each software update, it's  interesting to have 
       way to save persistent startup options.

Mar 01 2004
  j-chkmail 1.5-Alpha-2
  [FEATURE] Added support for ClamAV, using libclamav (experimental). 
     j-chkmail shall be configured and linked with clamav. Shall be configured
     as :

        SCANNER_PROTOCOL           CLAMAV
        SCANNER_SAVE               YES

Feb 23 2004
  j-chkmail 1.5-040223 - AKA j-chkmail-1.5-Alpha-1
  [CHANGE] Scripts to handle new format of j-stats file were finished.
  [BUG] Boundaries detection when some special characteres appear at
	boundary string.
  [CHANGE] A new configuration file was created (j-xfiles) allowing one
        to adding new options do xfiles definition, based at the same time
        on the mime type and a regular expression for the filename.

Feb 12 2004
  j-chkmail 1.5-040212
  [BUG] Corrected external antivirus interface problem. Checked under Solaris

  [FEATURE] Adding support to SpamTraps (experimental)
  [CHANGE] all dependencies of old libcompat were removed.
  [CHANGE] /var/jchkmail/j-stats file format has changed. Scripts on
        contrib directory are being changed to handle new file format.

Jan 21 2004
  j-chkmail 1.5 040121
  [CHANGE] Specific build directory created for j-makemap. j-makemap will 
        be the equivalent of sendmail makemap tool, used to create and 
        dump database files.
  [CHANGE] Changes at the oracle - the weight of some tests were changed, 
        and some new statistical tests were created and had a first 
	validation.
  [CHANGE] j-checkspam tool was created allowing to check message files by 
	hand. The interest is to help developpement and maybe be a first
        prototype of what could be a postfix version of j-chkmail.
  [LICENSE] Changed from usual GPL open source model to a closer model. 
	Redistribution is no more allowed, and access to j-chkmail is 
	given only to to registered users

Jan 01 2004
  j-chkmail 1.5 0101

  [FEATURE] Support being added to use Berkeley DB with some configuration 
	files.
  [CHANGE] Code cleaning after validation of old features.
  [CHANGE] Specific build directories created for j-scanfile and j-printstats
	tools.

Dec 15 2003 - Jose Marcio Martins da Cruz
  j-chkmail 1.5

  [FEATURE] -m and -n options added to j-chkmail to generate commented current 
	runtime configuration and default 
        configuration files.
  [FEATURE] one thread was create on the filter server to be able to handle 
	commands and queries from an external source - See CTRL_* configuration
	options.
        At the moment, the following commands work :
            STATS ORACLE
            STATS THROTTLE
            STATS CONNRATE
            STATS CONNOPEN
            STATS COUNTERS
            RESET STATS
            RELOAD TABLES
            RECONFIG
            RESTART
        A simple perl client (j-ndc) was created (look for it at bin directory) 
	to contact the control
        channel.
  [CHANGE] configuration options names of variables used to check message 
	contents were changed to become more understandeable.
  [FEATURE] A simple client was added to the filter, in order to replace 
	features related to external scanner. For the while, the external 
	scanner may  be launched by inetd - see example at contrib/ufilter 
	subtree. Some day on the future, the client will be able to talk 
	to sophie and other external scanners.
	See SCANNER_* configuration options. Experimental.
  [DOC] INSTALL file received some useful information...
        Read it for some basic instructions on how to install/upgrade j-chkmail
	from previous versions.

MMM DD 2003 - Jose Marcio Martins da Cruz
  j-chkmail 1.4

  [FEATURE] -m option added to j-chkmail to create configuration file from 
        runtime configuration
  [BUG] Checking X-Files of base 64 encoded file names
  [CHANGE] Remove useless caracteres (e.g. spaces, points...) at end of file 
        before checking if it's a XFile. Only one charactere was removed 
        before.
  [BUG] Bug checking filenames against regular expressions.
  [FEATURE] - sendmail message id is now logged with milter
	logs.
  [FEATURE] - Content checking engine was completely rewritten
	allowing checking inside coded mime-parts
  [FEATURE] - Content checking now supports also taging messages instead 
        of simply reject. Moreover, there are now two spam levels of content 
        checking :
	- greater than CONTENT_CHECK_SCORE
	- greater than 0 and lower than CONTENT_CHECK_SCORE
	You can define what to do for both cases : reject, discard or 
        simply add a X-j-chkmail-Score header.	
  [FEATURE] - Add somme fuzzy verifications called "ORACLE". Activate it 
        with SPAM_ORACLE configuration switch
  [FEATURE] - Preliminar score definition combining results from content 
        checking score and oracle score. Final score is presented as the 
        number of 'X's on the X-j-chkmail-Score header.
  [FEATURE] - Added support to use PCRE instead of native REGEX libraries - 
        engine goes two times faster. It really rocks...
	Tested with pcre 4.3 version pcre can be obtained at :
	 ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/
  [FEATURE] - script to do statistics of content checking. 
	Working in progress. Check it in the contrib tree
  [FEATURE] - some more j-printstats query options
  [FEATURE] - checking more gateway behaviour - dictionnary attacks and too 
        much open connections
  [CHANGE] - Process specific state files (socket and pid) default directories 
        were changed from /var/jchkmail to /var/run, as this last directory 
        is cleaned up at boot time under some OSs (Solaris, at least)
  [FEATURE] - Begin using j-user-access file, to allow change filtering 
        behavior for some particular sender addresses of smtp clients.
  [PORT] - Ported to FreeBSD, Tru64 and NetBSD - Thanks to Emmanuel Dreyfus 
        and Michel Bidaud
  [BUGS] - Corrected some bugs on checking subject and sender content. 
        Pb. signaled by Russell Berry.
  [CHANGE] - Configuration options UNIX_SOCK and INET_SOCK removed as they 
        were causing confusion

	  if j-chkmail has execution access.

Mar 07 2003 - Jose Marcio Martins da Cruz
	j-chkmail 1.3.1RC5
  [FEATURE] - -q option added to j-printstats. Allows query
	   about gateway activity during some past time period
           Try j-printstats -q
               j-printstats -q -l 86400 
	       j-printstats -q -l 6h hostname

Dec 05 2002 - Jose Marcio Martins da Cruz
	j-chkmail 1.3 Release
	[BUG/CHECKING] - Global checking of new features and some
	  code cleaning. Very little bugs between last RC and final release
	[CHANGE] - Default configuration directory changed from /etc/mail
	  to /etc/mail/jchkmail, as suggested by J. D. Bronson.
	[BUG] - TAGS inside comment lines inside j-error-msg file were 
	  taken into account.

Oct 15 2002 - Jose Marcio Martins da Cruz
	j-chkmail 1.3RC7
	[BUG/CHECKING] - Body content checking testing done with the help 
	  of Ayamura.Kikuchi
	[FEATURE] - Content checking of HELO command. Suggested by
	  Ayamura Kikuchi.
	[UPDATE] - Code for content checking of all headers finished.
	[FEATURE] - script to generate weekly statistics (look for it
	  at contrib/scripts directory)
	[FEATURE] - Configuration parameters of periodic cleaning up of 
	  old quarantined files :  CLEANUP_INTERVAL and QUARANTINE_MAX_AGE.

Oct 08 2002 - Jose Marcio Martins da Cruz
	j-chkmail 1.3RC6
	[FEATURE] - Content checking has two new parameters and the other
	    one has changed
	  CONTENT_CHECK_SIZE - to check message contents only if message size 
	    is below specified parameter
	  CONTENT_CHECK_ORIGIN - to check message contents comes from anywhere
            or only if message comes from unknown IP networks.
	  CONTENT_REGEX_MATCHES changed to CONTENT_CHECK_SCORE. Score needed
	    to reject a message is no more the number of matches, but the
	    sum of weights (each regular expression may have a different
	    weight on the decision to reject the message).In order to realize
	    this, a new weight parameter was added to j-regex file.
	[FEATURE] - now checks contents of base 64 encoded message body.
	[FEATURE] - added __MSGID__ parameter to j-error-file, to indicate 
	  the file name of quarantined message.
	[FEATURE] - added periodic cleaning up of spool directories with 
	  cleaning periodicity and max age configurable.
	[BUG] - j-chkmail stops logging when it receives a HUP signal to reload
	   configuration (/etc/init.d/jchkmail reload). Problem noted by 
	   Jeff. D. Bronson
        [BUG] - jchkmail start-up script. Now verify and delete pid file before
	  launching j-chkmail if there are no daemons running. Thanks to 
	  Patrick Gatt who remarked the problem and proposed a solution.
	
Oct 04 2002 - Jose Marcio Martins da Cruz
	j-chkmail 1.3RC5
        [UPDATE] Some documentation updates, some checks...
	
Sep 30 2002 - Jose Marcio Martins da Cruz
	[FEATURE] - Content check code is completed. Body and body content
          may be verified agains a list of regular expressions. If the number
	  of matches is greater than the threshold, message is rejected.
	  Experimental feature. Too much time consumming.
	[FEATURE] - Messages which body is completely encoded in base64 or
	  quoted-printable to avoid content checking may be refused. I'm
	  not talking about attachment encoding, but entire message body 
	  encoding. Experimental feature - don't use it as it may block
	  legitimate messages.
	[BUG] Problems when configuring j-chkmail to use tables in the
	  database format. Corrected, but this is allways an experimental 
	  feature.
	
Sep 24 2002 - Jose Marcio Martins da Cruz
	j-chkmail 1.3RC1
        [FEATURE] - this minor address the vulnerability generated by sending
	  fragmented messages (message/partial MIME type).
          Problem reported by the alert 
            http://www.securiteam.com/securitynews/5YP0A0K8CM.html
	[FEATURE] - some minor changes to verify the vulnerability of sending
	  attached files by reference (message/external-body MIME type).
	  At the moment, this vulnerability wasn't announced anywhere, in
          my knowledge.
	[FEATURE] External (antivirus or spam) scanners are now launched 
	  by a pre-forked server instead of a concurrent server.
	[FEATURE] Interface to user defined mail scanner.
	[FEATURE] Configuration tables storage format selectable between
	  text files or database files (db, ndbm or gdbm) formats. This is
	  experimental. Not all tables are already ported to database 
	  formats.
	[FEATURE] Mail filtering according to mail gateway DNS resolution 
	  (failure or forged)
	[FEATURE] Access (black/white list), allowing to override bad DNS 
	  resolution results.
        [FEATURE] Temporal quota management of number of connection allowed
