    [Ill Computer]     File Extensions

      Navigation               There is currently a big push toward
                               relying heavily on recognizing "bad"
   Virus Protection            file extensions and acting solely on
                                    this knowledge. That's not
                                   necessarily a good thing as
 [Virus Tutorial Map]             extensions can be misleading.

                       One of the most asked questions lately is "What
                       extensions should I scan and/or watch for in E-mail
  Anti-Virus Software  attachments?" While a valid question, some caveats
                       must be attached to the answer.

                       First, it's important to note that over time
                       Microsoft (and others) appear to be working toward
                       making file extensions as the sole indicator of file
                       content and creator unnecessary. This already exists
                       on the Macintosh where the file creator information
                       is in the file itself so the file name and extension
                       is no indicator at all of the type of file.

                       Such behavior is starting to appear under Windows as
                       well. Microsoft Word, for example, will actually
                       examine a file it's asked to open and, despite the
                       name ending in .DOC, if the file is a template file
                       will open the file as a template (.DOT) file
                       instead. Some Word macro viruses take advantage of
                       this characteristic and save infected files in
                       template format with a .DOC extension.

                       Another variant of this behavior on Windows
                       computers would be the Scrap Object file which
                       actually can contain most anything from simple text
                       to complex programs. When opened, the operating
                       system determines what the content is and acts
                       accordingly.

                       Finally, there is the issue of double extensions. To
                       make your viewing easier, Windows offers the option
                       of turning off the viewing of file extensions. If
                       you do that, however, you can easily be fooled by
                       files with double extensions. Most everyone has been
                       conditioned, for example, that the extension .TXT is
                       safe as it indicates a pure text file. But, with
                       extensions turned off if someone sends you a file
                       named BAD.TXT.VBS you will only see BAD.TXT. If
                       you've forgotten that extensions are actually turned
                       off you might think this is a text file and open it.
                       Instead, this is really an executable VisualBasic
                       Script file and could do serious damage. For now you
                       should always have viewing extensions turned on.
                       Here's how...

                       In Windows 98 double click to open "My Computer" and
                       then select "View"|"Folder Options". Select the
                       "View" tab and then scroll down to the entry that
                       says "Hide file extensions for known file types" and
                       make certain it's not checked. Click OK and then
                       close the My Computer window. With this move you
                       will now see extensions in file directory windows
                       and the option will be picked up by other Microsoft
                       programs like Outlook.

                       Extensions

                       So, with the thought in mind that file extensions
                       are likely being phased out over time and can be
                       spoofed, here are some to watch out for ("?"

                              .386   Windows Enhanced Mode Driver.
                                     A device driver is executable
                                     code and, as such, can be
                                     infected and should be
                                     scanned.
                              .ADE   Microsoft Access Project
                                     Extension. Use of macros makes
                                     this vulnerable.
                              .ADP   Microsoft Access Project. Use

                                     vulnerable.
                              .ADT   Abstract Data Type. According
                                     to Symantec these are

                                     these files interact with such
                                     things as database programs to
                                     make them look like standalone
                                     programs.
                              .ASP   Active Server Page.
                                     Combination program and HTML

                                     files that contain system
                                     commands. There have been a
                                     few batch file viruses but
                                     they are not common.
                              .BIN   Binary File. Can be used for a
                                     variety of tasks and usually
                                     associated with a program.
                                     Like an overlay file it's
                                     possible to infect .BIN files
                                     but not usually likely.

                                     never been made clear why or
                                     how these can become infected
                                     but Symantec includes them in
                                     their default listing.
                              .CHM   Compiled HTML Help File. Use
                                     of scripting makes these
                                     vulnerable.
                              .CLA   Java Class File. Java applets
                              .CLASS are supposed to be run in a
                                     "sandbox" and thus be isolated
                                     from the system. However,
                                     users can be tricked into
                                     running an applet in a mode
                                     that the sandbox considers
                                     "secure" so Class files should
                                     be scanned.
                              .CMD   Windows NT Command Script. A

                                     infected in a variety of ways.
                              .CPL   Control Panel Extension.
                                     Similar to a device driver
                                     which is executable code and,
                                     as such, can be infected and
                                     should be scanned.
                              .CRT   Security Certificate. Can have
                                     code associated with it.

                                     should be scanned.
                              .CSS   Hypertext Cascading Style
                                     Sheet. Style sheets can
                                     contain code.
                              .DLL   Dynamic Link Library. Can be
                                     used for a variety of tasks
                                     associated with a program.
                                     DLLs typically add functions
                                     to programs. Some contain
                                     executable code; others simply
                                     contain functions or data but
                                     you can't tell by looking so
                                     all DLLs should be scanned.
                              .DOC   MS Word Document. Word
                                     documents can contain macros
                                     that are powerful enough to be
                                     used for viruses and worms.
                              .DOT   MS Word Document Template.
                                     Word templates can contain
                                     macros that are powerful
                                     enough to be used for viruses
                                     and worms.
                              .DRV   Device Driver. A device driver
                                     is executable code and, as
                                     such, can be infected and
                                     should be scanned.
                              .EML   MS Outlook Express E-mail.
                              or     E-mail messages can contain
                              .EMAIL HTML and scripts. Many viruses
                                     and worms use this vector.
                              .EXE   Executable File. Any
                                     executable file can be

                                     font file can have executable
                                     code in it and therefore can
                                     be infected.
                              .HLP   Help File. Help files can
                                     contain macros. They are not a
                                     common vector but have housed
                                     a Trojan or two.
                              .HTA   HTML Program. Can contain
                                     scripts.

                                     which are more and more
                                     becoming vectors.
                              .INF   Setup Information. Setup
                                     scripts can be changed to do

                                     be changed to point unexpected
                                     places.
                              .ISP   Internet Communication

                              .JS    JavaScript. As script files
                              .JSE   become vectors more often it's
                                     best to scan them. (.JSE is
                                     encoded. Also keep in mind
                                     that these can have other,

                                     files could be infected but to
                                     date no LIB-file virus has
                                     been identified.

                                     safe, they should be scanned.
                                     RTF files can also be DOC
                                     files renamed and Word will

                                     should generally be avoided if
                                     one is sent to you but are
                                     routinely used by the

                              .XL?   MS Excel File. Excel
                                     worksheets can contain macros
                                     that are powerful enough to be
                                     used for viruses and worms.

                       The above listing has been derived from the default
                       extension lists of various anti-virus programs and
                       from discussions in virus-related newsgroups. It
                       should not be taken as an absolute however. Some
                       viruses/worms have been spread in files with no
                       extension and, as noted, an extension does not
                       necessarily guarantee a particular file type. The
                       meaning for extensions not listed here might be
                       found at http://filext.com/.

                       The safe option is to allow anti-virus software to
                       scan all files.

                       Summary

                          * While extensions are often touted as being
                            accurate indicators of files that can be
                            infected, history shows they are not.
                            Additionally, they can be spoofed in a variety
                            of ways.
                          * The safe option is to allow anti-virus software
                            to scan all files.
